War is but one of many tools to establish your reign, as real strategy requires expert diplomatic skill, mastery of your realm, and true cunning. Crusader Kings III continues the popular series made by Paradox Development Studio, featuring the widely acclaimed marriage of immersive grand strategy and deep, dramatic medieval roleplaying. \r\n\r\n\r\nA bloodline begins\r\n  \r\n\u2022 Take command of your house and expand your dynasty through a meticulously researched Middle Ages. Begin in 867 or 1066 and claim lands, titles, and vassals to secure a realm worthy of your royal blood. Your death is only a footnote as your lineage continues with new playable heirs, either planned\u2026 or not. \r\n\u2022 Discover a sprawling simulated world teeming with peasants and knights, courtiers, spies, knaves and jesters, and secret love affairs. An extensive cast of historical characters can be romanced, betrayed, executed, or subtly influenced.  \r\n\u2022 Explore a vast medieval map stretching from the snowswept Nordic lands to the Horn of Africa, and the British Isles in the west to the exotic riches of Burma in the east. Claim, conquer, and rule thousands of unique counties, duchies, kingdoms, and empires. \r\n\r\n\r\nLarger than life \r\n\r\n\u2022 Each character is larger than life, with traits and lifestyle choices determining their actions and schemes. Prompt fear and dread as you rule with an iron fist, or inspire your subjects with magnanimous deeds. Genetics can be passed along to your children, be it the gift of genius or crippling stupidity. \r\n\u2022 Groom your heir with the appropriate guardians or educate them yourself. If found wanting, marry them off or despatch them through other means. \r\n\u2022 Customize your ruler and noble house, from appearance to attributes, and create a monarch worthy of all their inherited virtues and vices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReal strategy requires cunning\r\n\r\n\u2022 Govern an ever-evolving realm and grant titles to whom you see fit - or usurp your liege to claim their crown as your own. Be wary of rivals, from restless serfs to revengeful concubines. \r\n\u2022 The shadows stir frequently, and danger lurks around every darkened corner. Recruit agents and other unsavory elements to undermine, blackmail, or murder those who stand in your path. Or be inspired by the bard and ballad, and seduce your way to power and influence.\r\n\u2022 Blood will flow. Assemble men-at-arms units and powerful knights. Manage your battlefield tactics and armies. Raid and plunder nearby lands or hire mercenaries and Holy Orders for your major conflicts. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccomplish great things\r\n\r\n\u2022 Be a pious king to invite the religious powers to your side, or design your own faith as you battle between everlasting fame or eternal damnation.\r\n\u2022 Bring novel innovations to your culture and construct mighty castles and bastions to increase the wealth, prestige, and security of your realm. \r\n\u2022 The paths to follow are limitless: experience thousands of dynamic events and life-altering decisions tailored to each and every conceivable situation and character. There are countless ways of securing and keeping your place in the history books. \r\n\r\n",

Gather your Evilness in new and dynamic ways and unleash it upon the lush green forests and plains of the Overworld to turn them over to the dark side. But make sure that your Dungeon is well-secured by traps and defended by your creatures, for those pesky Overworlders won\u2019t just twiddle their thumbs while you turn their land into the Absolute Evil\u2019s most pleasurable holiday paradise. \r\n\r\nBut what is that noise? \u201cGold, gold, gold and gems, gold and gems and gold!\u201d The ancient song echoes throughout the underworld, accompanied by the clanging steel of hammers and axes. The Dwarves have arrived to claim their share of the abundant resources and together with the Elves and Humans of the Overworld, they send out their raiding parties to find the Dungeon\u2019s heart.\r\n\r\nDungeons 4 keeps the spirit of its predecessor, but everything is now bigger, better, and with even more dynamic Evilness\u2122.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\u2022 Everything is better with Dwarves\u2122: The Dwarves have arrived to build their underground strongholds and the hardy little fellows (although they don\u2019t like being called that) compete with the Ever-Expanding Evil for space and resources.\r\n\r\n\u2022 It makes your Dungeon great again: Dungeons are up four times larger than before and there are many more creatures who wait for the All-Commanding Evil\u2019s orders to conquer the Overworld. Now the time has come for massive armies and truly sprawling dungeons!\r\n\r\n\u2022 Ripe for the taking: The Overworld is bigger than ever before. Gain Evilness by beating Mini Bosses like the obsessively harmonious Unicorn and use it to transform the Overworld into stunning biomes of pure evil. \r\n\r\n\u2022 New and shiny: An ability-based Perk system for Thalya, the Absolute Evil\u2019s trusted *cough* and most loyal subordinate, grants her impressive new powers. The Absolute Evil can now enjoy taking over the world, governing the creatures and slapping subordinates even more with the customizable Evil Hand.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Minions, everywhere: The Horde, the Undead and the Demons wait to do the Absolute Evil\u2019s bidding, with more creatures than ever eagerly following the gesturing Evil\u2019s orders, and Snots will play a much more prominent role this time.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Many ways to tell the story: A long campaign, narrated by the beloved English Narrator from previous titles, as well as several skirmish maps all to challenge your rule as the Absolute Evil.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Change the world: Spread your Evilness across the Overworld to bring lush and green environments over to the dark side, now shining even more vibrantly and beautifully evil as you spread your evilness across many new biomes.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Work together, slay together: 2-player co-op multiplayer with both players managing one Dungeon together. All maps from the campaign and the skirmish mode are playable in co-op.",

Bring your friends into the frontier in your own private server, or make new friends (and enemies) in large public multiplayer servers. Play peacefully in co-op, or use the dynamic multiplayer faction system to band together and split apart dynamically as allegiances change.\r\n\r\nBuild ships from scratch and travel to new planets. Your first planet is where you\u2019ll learn to survive, but that\u2019s just the start. Build your very own starship and use it to colonise new worlds. It won\u2019t be easy, and only the most successful colonies will be able to pool the resources and knowledge necessary to break orbit. Once you launch, the stars hold brand-new planets, new biomes, bosses and challenges.\r\n\r\nCraft, research, loot and exploit your environment. You\u2019ll need to prepare to take on this hostile part of the galaxy. Get mining, farming, growing, developing, researching, and building hundreds of different items, from winter combat gear to advanced laboratories. Find something you can\u2019t work out for yourself. Strap on your handcrafted laser rifle and venture out into the unknown to explore dungeons, procedural bases, NPC stores and much more.\r\n\r\nDefend what you\u2019ve built, or take on the galaxy. Defend your colony with fast-paced combat that utilizes physics like bullet drop, projectile speed and spread. Thwart enemy raids on your base with your stock of handcrafted grenades. Tired of just defending? Lay waste to enemy bases with destructible terrain as you wield everything from rusty old carbines to nuke launchers and energy weapons that harness the power of lightning!\r\n\r\nDevelop and construct advanced bases for protection. Grow from a tiny outpost into an advanced, nuclear-powered fortress. Manage resources carefully and choose research paths based on the items and challenges you encounter on each planet. Watch out, though: the bigger your colony gets, the more of a target it becomes for raiders (and jealous friends).\r\n\r\nAutomate work and train up a team. Even out here, you\u2019re not alone. Save AI survivors and build a colony together. A range of unique stats, perks and flaws mean every colonist has something different to contribute. As your AI colonists complete tasks they\u2019ll level up and get smarter, stronger and faster. Best of all, you can assign tasks and orders to NPCs to do the grunt work for you and prioritize their roles based on those skills. Want to take a break from mining to destroy an underground alien nest? Let your colonists handle that for you!\r\n\r\nAnd Remember\r\n\r\nYour ship may be in ruins, your ammunition running low, and your teammates scattered across the surface, but remember this:\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re more than just another adventurous spirit.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re a Farworld Pioneer.",

Some nay-sayers have called the magnifying glass \"useless\", but what do they know?\r\n\r\nIn Case 1, The Haunted Island, a sloth has been haunted for weeks by a mysterious ghost that nobody can seem to track down. Even after hiring a team of ghost scientists, the mystery is no closer to being solved. Luckily for this tropical sloth, and unluckily for this pesky ghost, Frog Detective is here to crack the case! The Haunted Island is the first in this award-winning series, and this bite-sized mystery is what started an international cult obsession with the world of Frog Detective.\r\n\r\nIn the second mystery, The Case of the Invisible Wizard, we follow the Detective to Warlock Woods, where a celebratory parade for their newest neighbor has been maliciously destroyed. Now the neighbor is nowhere to be seen, and the town is in ruin. Can Frog Detective get to the bottom of things? We sure hope so, otherwise the game would be a bummer.\r\n\r\nIn the exciting series finale, Corruption at Cowboy County, The Detective and Lobster Cop are tasked to solve the conundrum of a sheriff-less town. But not all is as it seems here, when a surprisingly simple solution to the case reveals a sinister scheme. Maybe crime is real after all...\r\nThis final mystery is jam-packed with twists and turns, a true love letter to the Frog Detective fans.\r\n\r\nFrog Detective: The Entire Mystery is a family-friendly yet witty take on the detective game genre. Solve the mysteries on your own, or play along with friends as you take turns reading out the dialogue.

As the leader of possibly the last civilized society on Earth, you\u2019re going to build the city your survivors live in, discover new technologies, explore frozen wastelands and most importantly, manage and rule society to prepare it for life in an unforgiving world. Whether you\u2019re an enlightened ruler or an iron-fisted tyrant, you\u2019ll discover choices in this world aren\u2019t as easy as they seem, and that holding power over people has a cost as heavy as the responsibility you feel in caring for them.\r\n\r\nSHAPE YOUR SOCIETY\r\nEstablish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment \u2013 the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe. If you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. \r\n\r\nShould you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Some of your decisions will seem small \u2013 like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction \u2013 but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless.\r\n\r\nEXPAND AND EXPLORE\r\nSurvival demands progress. React to current events, but don\u2019t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships, and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills.\r\n\r\nWhile New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your society\u2019s population. There may be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands.\r\n",

Inspired by timeless classic ARPG's such as Diablo 2 and Titan Quest, Ghostlore features a detailed item and character customization system, procedurally generated maps, and authentic 90's retro graphics.\n\nLORE COMES TO LIFE\nThe bloodthirsty Penanggal is a gruesome creature with origins in Malay folklore. It comprises of nothing more than a disembodied head and dangling entrails. The Indonesian Babi Ngepet myth tells of sorcerors who sacrifice their humanity in order to become boar demons. The tales of Hungry Ghosts are superstitions brought over by Chinese immigrants - undead horrors cursed to remain forever hungry due to their greed in mortal life.\n\nStories from the maritime region of Southeast-Asia are full of all manner of nightmarish, horrifying creatures. Are you brave enough to face them? Discover over 40 different enemies, each with their quirks and tactics to defeat based on their descriptions in folklore.\n\nA WORLD LIKE NO OTHER\nExplore a procedurally generated world that takes inspiration from the developers' home country of Singapore, its two closest neighbours, Malaysia and Indonesia, and the rest of Southeast Asia.\n\nPlayers unfamiliar with the region will get to experience a culture that is underrepresented and rarely seen in other forms of media. Players who live in Southeast Asia will find plenty of things they recognize - such as the food! Collect and prepare various meals to boost your stats. Don't fight on an empty stomach!\n\nMULTI CLASS SYSTEM\nGhostlore allows you to mix-and-match abilities from 3 out of 6 character classes to create your own unique hero. The 6 classes are:\n\u2022 The Adept: Mystic warriors skilled in Martial Arts, honing their mind as well as their body.\n\u2022 The Exorcist: Able to sense the spirit world with ESP and cast out evil spirits.\n\u2022 The Feral: Fearless fighters bestowed with the power of blood magic and the ability to transform into a Weretiger.\n\u2022 The Geomancer: Masters of the art of bending the elemental forces of Earth, Fire, Ice and Lightning to their will.\n\u2022 The Hashashin: Shadowy assassins who rely on speed and stealth to take down opponents.\n\u2022 The Sentinel: Keepers of the forest with the ability to communicate with animals.\n\nBUILD YOUR OWN SKILL TREES WITH THE SKILL LINK SYSTEM\nEach class comes with a \u201cskill set\u201d, a pool containing active skills, skill modifiers, and passive class bonuses. Skills must be assigned to a grid in order to be usable. More grid spaces unlock as you level up. Things can be placed in or taken out of the grid at will.\n\nSkill modifiers can be used to change the characteristics of any active skill from any class. Skill modifiers link together with active skills both across and down. (see green highlighted area in image). Some skill modifiers have tradeoffs.\n\nSome skill modifiers are trigger modifiers. Trigger modifiers allow a skill to be used automatically, as long as there is enough MP, the skill is not on cooldown, and the modifier\u2019s specified conditions are met.\n\nCOMBO SKILLS\nEach active skill is also able to combine with skills from other classes to form an advanced skill that incorporates the characteristics of both base skills. Combo skills are created when two compatible skills are placed adjacent to one another in the skill grid.\n\nGLYPH SYSTEM\nThe Glyph system is where Ghostlore brings something truly new to the Action-RPG table. In your travels you will find Glyphs - magical symbols that you can inscribe onto your body to gain new powers.Each Glyph takes up space on your body (represented in game as a grid). As your level increases, so do the number of glyphs you can inscribe onto yourself.Here's where things get interesting: Compound glyphs are rare and special glyphs that use 5 normal glyph spaces, but grant additional bonuses to glyphs that are placed within their configuration. Plan your Compound Glyph layout in order to maximise stat bonuses!In Ghostlore, you can wield a variety of weapons prevalent in Southeast-Asian martial arts:\u2022 The Kris or Keris - a blade with a distinctively wavy shape. It is a well-balanced weapon.\n\u2022 The Bow and Arrow has been a staple of hunting since the dawn of time; apparently they come in handy with ghost-hunting as well!\n\u2022 Parangs, also known as machetes, are cleaving blades with a wide arc.\n\u2022 The deadly Kukri knives are the fastest attacking melee weapons in the game.\n\u2022 The trusty Spear has the longest reach out of all the melee weapons.\n\u2022 Finally, there are enchanted Talismans that can fly and give foes nasty papercuts.\n\nIn addition, you can find and equip a variety of Amulets. Amulets are commonly sold in many parts of real world Southeast Asia as good luck charms. In the world of Ghostlore, their power is very, very real. Equipping the right Amulet for the situation can mean the difference between a glorious victory and an untimely demise.Additionally, items can be modified in a couple of unique ways:\n\nSpirits inhabiting items are the reason why some of them have magical properties. Visit the Psychic to awaken the spirits which lay dormant in items such as weapons, shields, hats, scarves and amulets. Once awakened, the spirit will ask you to settle a score. Upon fulfilment of the request, your item will strengthen with new enchantments.Based on actual Southeast Asian folklore, the Orang Bunian are nature spirits that you can meet in your travels. On rare occasion, they will bless your items with new, random properties.\n\nNEVER FIGHT ALONE\n\u2022 Local co-op multiplier lets you play with up to 4 of your friends on the same screen.\n\u2022 Modding support allows you to customise your experience with mods from the community.\n\u2022 The Shrine of Balance is an optional asynchronous multiplayer feature which lets you help other players by sending them equipment. You have better chances of good loot in return when they use your equipment.\n\u2022 The Shrine of Spirits is another optional asynchronous online multiplayer mechanic where a 'snapshot' of another player's current character (also known as their 'Ghost Data') can be temporarily summoned into the your own game as an ally NPC.\n\nENDLESS CHALLENGES\nMission Mode: Undertake randomized missions after completing the campaign. Unlock Map Data, which allows you to modify missions and change the odds more to your favour. See how far you can go in the Hell Gate Island's Endless Mode",

Purchase only if you are comfortable with the current state of the unfinished game. \r\n\r\nInkulinati is an ink-based strategy game straight from medieval manuscripts, where a rabbit\u2019s bum can be deadlier than a dog's sword.\r\n\r\nTake your turn in Inkulinati duels filled with unexpected tactical depth (and humour!). Embark on an ever-changing journey, build your own bestiary, defeat medieval superstars and collect perks to unleash special powers.\r\n\r\nBecome a master of the Living Ink, grab your quill and build your unique strategy time after time so that you can be named the greatest Inkulinati of all time!\r\n\r\nINKULINATI IS INSPIRED BY REAL-LIFE MEDIEVAL MARGINALIA\r\n700 years in the making, finally these bizarre art pieces can come alive in a video game and show that medieval people also had their \u201cmemes\u201d and that they laughed from the same silly things that we do today. You\u2019ll see sword-wielding rabbits, dogs with spears, trumpets lodged in bottoms, human-eating snails, and more. Much, much more\u2026\r\n\r\nFIGHT LIKE AN INKULINATI\r\nInkulinati are a legendary group who battle one another on the pages of medieval manuscripts. They fight by drawing Beasts with the Living Ink. Thanks to this magical substance, those creatures come to life and an epic battle ensues.Move your Beasts across the battlefield, perform actions on or with them, make tactical use of obstacles and collect more Living Ink to draw new Beasts which allows you to gain an advantage over your opponent.\r\n\r\nMULTIPLE DEADLY (AND BIZARRE) BEASTS TO UNLOCK\r\nDonkeys playing trumpets with their bottoms, bishop cats vanquishing heretics with prayers, heavy but deadly snails that eat units alive, and more. Much, much more. They all have their special skills and are waiting for your command.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL, BATTLE TIDE-TURNING ACTIONS PERFORMED BY THE INKULINATI\r\nIt\u2019s not just your Beasts that can cause havoc and damage. Use your fists to smash your opponent's units, draw obstacles to create barriers, relocate your units with a move of your finger, or explode your troops to create pure, pure chaos. Just remember - your opponent can do it too.\r\n\r\nADAPT YOUR TACTIC TO EVERY BATTLE\r\nEach Inkulinati has its own army, with different Beasts, who in turn, have different abilities, strengths, and unfortunately, weaknesses (or fortunately - depending which side you\u2019re on). But it\u2019s not just the armies that can influence who will win any given duel. Each Battlefield is its own domain, with its own particular dangers that you should watch out for, and opportunities that you can use. You will have to use your wits and adapt your strategy to beat the opposing Inkulinati\u2019s army on each specific Battlefield.\r\n\r\nA SINGLE-PLAYER CAMPAIGN\r\nUncover the mystery and secrets of Inkulinati and face such opponents as Death, Dante Alighieri, and more. Go out into the world and start your adventure! Fight the biggest Inkulinati masters in the land, tame the untamed Beasts, build your ultimate army, try to bring back your Master from the clutches of death, and most importantly, finish your grand quest with the biggest party that the middle ages have ever seen! Howza!!!\r\n\r\nCREATE AND DEVELOP YOUR OWN CHARACTER\r\nAs any aspiring Inkulinati Master, you will get to create your own Tiny-Inkulinati. During your journey you will learn the secret techniques of drawing new Beasts and Inkulinati Hand Actions, allowing you to choose the composition of your army. You can be a brave knight that has no fear and will send his loyal troops straight at his opponents. Or perhaps you would like to play with a bit more tact? In that case, you can be a nun who with the power of prayer can confuse her enemies and heal thy own servants. Those styles, and more, are waiting to be discovered and made your own. Express yourself!\r\n\r\nEVERY BATTLE HAS ITS OWN STORY\r\nTo mark every battle in history books for all future generations to see, a procedurally generated text describes the dramatic (or hilarious) events in detail just above the battlefield.",

But venture further out, and start to feel small as things get larger and larger - to the point where cracks in the ground become chasms.\r\n \r\nIn Maquette you will explore the scales of everyday problems in a modern-day love story.

A wanna-be hero who keeps getting mixed up in the most unbelievable situations you can imagine.\r\n\r\nLevels\r\nOne moment you're stuck in a speeding train headed towards the cliff; the other, you're in a falling plane. Sometimes you need to win an impossible-to-win soccer match, and the other, you're a dinosaur trying to hide from a meteorite. Stuck in a flaming house? Sandwiched between two battling armies? Certainly not a problem for McPixel! 100 levels of fast-paced action are waiting for you!\r\n\r\nMinigames\r\nSometimes, the usual adventure style will get interrupted by genre-bending minigames. Ranging from racing, shooting, fighting, and sports to even platforming or FPS! The game offers over 20 minigames scattered around the world of McPixel!\r\n\r\nCoins and stamps\r\nMcPixel is not all about just saving the day but having fun trying to come up with the craziest possible solutions. And for every solution, you will be rewarded with coins! Find all solutions in a level to get the gold prize and some extra coins! You can use them to unlock new levels! Also, everyone loves coins, right? They're shiny and golden and spinning! No reason not to have some more!\r\n\r\nMcBurg\r\nThe game takes place in the city of McBurg. Explore the city and find different adventures! Some of the paths in the city are blocked and will require you to spend coins to move forward and access new levels! The city will get populated with characters and items from the levels you already visited as you play. You will also be able to don some of the costumes you found while playing.\r\n\r\nOn the edge of the city upon a grassy hill, you can see a Devolver vault, full of gold, looming over McBurg. So, if you ever need a lot of coins, maybe it's time to pay Fork Parker a visit?\r\n\r\nSteve\r\nSometimes, during your adventures, you will find Steve. Steve can be in the weirdest and most unexpected of places, and finding him will transport you to the Steve level.\r\n\r\nSteve is not like McPixel and doesn't specialize in saving the day. He's just some guy, doing stuff. Like fishing, cooking, driving a car, or summoning demons. You know, just the average guy kind of stuff.\r\n\r\nKey Features:\r\n- 100 mind-blowing levels\r\n- Nearly 1000 hilarious gags to discover\r\n- Over 1500 interactive items\r\n- Over 20 minigames in all imaginable genres\r\n- Over 300,000,000 pixels\r\n- Steve\r\n- A water level",

Fly smoothly from deep space to planetary surfaces, with no loading screens, and no limits. In this infinite procedurally generated universe, you'll discover places and creatures that no other players have seen before - and perhaps never will again.\r\n\r\nEmbark on an epic voyage\r\nAt the centre of the galaxy lies a irresistible pulse which draws you on a journey towards it to learn the true nature of the cosmos. But, facing hostile creatures and fierce pirates, you'll know that death comes at a cost, and survival will be down to the choices you make over how you upgrade your ship, your weapon and suit.\r\n\r\nFind your own destiny\r\nYour voyage through No Man's Sky is up to you. Will you be a fighter, preying on the weak and taking their riches, or taking out pirates for their bounties? Power is yours if you upgrade your ship for speed and weaponry.\r\nOr a trader? Find rich resources on forgotten worlds and exploit them for the highest prices. Invest in more cargo space and you'll reap huge rewards.\r\nOr perhaps an explorer? Go beyond the known frontier and discover places and things that no one has ever seen before. Upgrade your engines to jump ever farther, and strengthen your suit for survival in toxic environments that would kill the unwary.\r\n\r\nShare your journey\r\nThe galaxy is a living, breathing place. Trade convoys travel between stars, factions vie for territory, pirates hunt the unwary, and the police are ever watching. Every other player lives in the same galaxy, and you can choose to share your discoveries with them on a map that spans known space. Perhaps you will see the results of their actions as well as your own...",

Several years after the crew\u2019s reign of terror over Washington DC has ended, they assemble once again to deal with the threat that roused them out of early retirement.\r\n\r\nThe Tightest Crew\r\n\r\nThe legendary Payday Crew, dreaded by the law and underworld alike, is back. Ripped from their peaceful retirement to rejoin the criminal world by a new threat, one born from the chaos the Crew left in their wake.\r\n\r\nIn order to identify and crush this new threat, the Crew is leaving their Washington DC roots behind them and moving to New York City.

In PAYDAY 3 the choice is put in the hands of the players, deciding how to tackle the heist, whether you sneak or go in guns blazing, whether you let your hostages go or keep them around as pawns, whether you go at it alone or bring friends. The choices are endless and in your hands, they will vastly change how the game plays.\r\n\r\nThrive in Co-op\r\n\r\nNot just anyone is worthy of standing at your side for something as important as a heist.

Purchase only if you are comfortable with the current state of the unfinished game.\r\n\r\nPhantom Abyss is a massive asynchronous multiplayer game that casts players into procedurally-generated temples and tasks them with retrieving the sacred relics hidden within deadly chambers. Intrepid adventurers will dodge scores of hidden traps, leap treacherous chasms, and flee relentless guardians through branching paths until one of the relics are claimed or the devices of death overwhelm them. Be warned, you only get one attempt at each temple and failure or settling for a lesser relic means you will never see that temple again...\r\n\r\nThe cleverest players will use the phantom runs of failed attempts from other players to their advantage and avoid the missteps and mistakes that led to their doom. Once the legendary relic at the bottom of each temple is found, the temple goes away forever and becomes the priceless trophy of the skilled adventurer.\r\n\r\nAsynchronous Multiplayer\r\nExplore the perilous halls and colossal rooms of each temple alongside the phantoms of fallen players that came before you. Use their successes and failures to your advantage to progress deeper than they ever could have hoped.\r\n\r\nUnlock More Treacherous Floors\r\nRecover keys from chests to unlock deeper, deadlier sections of the temple that house more coveted relics. The more difficult a relic is to obtain, the greater the reward - the final Legendary Relic of a temple allows you to claim the whole temple so that it's gone forever.\r\n\r\nBlessings from the Gods\r\nAs adventurers venture further into a temple, offerings of collected treasures can be made at altars to gain a new blessing for the rest of the run. Collect as much treasure as you can to please the gods and gain a double jump, glide jump, extended slide, damage protection, and more!\r\n\r\nUnlockable Whips\r\nUnlock new whips with success and choose from your collection before venturing into your next run. Each whips carries a minor blessing but also a curse that may complicate your attempt at riches and glory.\r\n\r\nFull details on the latest status of the game, how you can give feedback and report issues can be found at https://www.phantomabyss.com/",

Featuring turn-based tactical combat on procedurally generated maps, and resource management on a global scale, Phoenix Point offers endless replayability and a brutal challenge.\r\n\r\nFollowing a global environmental disaster, the Pandoravirus appeared and began reshaping creatures, including humans, into hideous mutants. Unable to stop the progress of the virus, much of human civilization was wiped out -- only small enclaves remain, separated by their principles and the vast landscape. The Phoenix Project, an ancient failsafe against global catastrophe is the only hope to unite mankind and take back the planet.\r\n\r\nLead the Phoenix Project from its base at Phoenix Point. Research and develop new technologies and techniques, plan operations, build alliances to unite the planet-- or simply destroy your rivals. It's up to you to save the planet and rebuild civilization, but there may be much more to the alien threat than meets the eye.\r\n\r\n* Mutating Alien Menace: Face down an ever-changing alien threat that adapts to your tactics and offers no respite even as your team becomes more powerful and technologically advanced.\r\n\r\n* Uncover the Secrets of the Pandoravirus: Phoenix Point features a complex narrative, with multiple endings that the player can only uncover via multiple playthroughs. Discover a secret history, as you learn about the origins of the mutants, the Pandoravirus, and Phoenix Point itself through exploration, diplomacy, and research.\r\n\r\n* Manage Diplomatic Relations: The Phoenix Project is not the only organization trying to reclaim the Earth. The militaristic New Jericho, the mystical Disciples of Anu, and the technophiles of Synedrion all offer unique rewards for co-operation and threats for opposition. It is up to you to decide how, or even if, to deal with them.\r\n\r\n* Take Aim on the Battlefield: In addition to equipping and commanding units, Phoenix Point lets you take direct control of your soldier's shots in combat, with a unique free-aiming system. Target enemy weakspots, weapons, or valuables, or just go for center mass.\r\n\r\n* Next-Gen Tech with Classic Pedigree: Phoenix Point was designed by Julian Gollop, the creator of the X-COM series in the 1990s. Keeping the core ethos of X-COM while updating the visuals, technology, and systems to modern standards has made Phoenix Point best-in-class.",

Boil and stir. Add the base: water, oil, or\u2026 something else. Congrats on your first potion! Was it easy to learn? Now try mastering it!\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT AND INVENT NEW RECEPIES\r\nCarefully plan your route via the Alchemy Map to combine different effects.

Or would you?\r\n\r\nSELL POTIONS\r\nEvery day customers will come to your store looking for solutions to their problems. You will face consequences depending on what you decide to sell them. Attract guilds, befriend notable figures (or feud with them), gain riches and influence - and one day, you may even decide the fate of the whole town.\r\n\r\nBUY INGREDIENTS OR GROW YOUR OWN\r\nEvery alchemist needs ingredients. You can buy them from traveling merchants: it can be pricey, but successful haggling may save you some coin. Or you can just grow your own!\r\n\r\nGET CREATIVE WITH CUSTOMIZING\r\nWant to give a special appearance to your best potions? Go ahead! Change bottle shape, label type, icon, and colors. You can even give it a custom name and label description. Carefully arrange your unique potions to showcase them on your shop\u2019s shelves and tables\u2026 or carelessly throw them around - we\u2019re not gonna tell you what to do, just have fun!",

Among them was the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge, who emerged without warning from the mountains of Germany, unleashing fire, death, and untold destruction across the countryside. It took German forces nearly four months to finally shoot her down - and when they did, their victory became known as The Dragonfall.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s 42 years later - 2054 - and the world has changed. Unchecked advances in technology have blurred the line between man and machine. Elves and trolls walk among us, ruthless corporations bleed the world dry, and Feuerschwinge\u2019s reign of terror is just a distant memory. Germany is splintered - a stable anarchy known as the \u201cFlux State\u201d controls the city of Berlin.

Those who rebel against the coalition take on a purely militant view, coming to the opinion that the only way to bring peace is by ultimately crushing all who oppose them - especially xenos.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in their history, the war creates a schism in the Advent Unity. The loyalists seek to continue their policy of revenge against the Traders, and to assimilate all others to the Unity\u2019s influence. However, others amongst the Advent suspect that a corrupting influence from within has diverted the Unity from its proper destiny.\r\n\r\nThe divide created in the Vasari Empire is less pronounced, but just as severe to their people. With the Vasari now practically frantic to move on to new space, the loyalist faction abandons cooperation and decides to take the resources they need by any means necessary. Having accepted the need to work together, the rebel faction feels that their best chance for survival is to work with the other races and bring them along to flee the approaching enemy.\r\n\r\nTake the battle for galactic supremacy to its ultimate level in Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion \u2013 a standalone RT4X game that combines the tactics of real-time strategy with the depth of the 4X genre (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate).",

        "description": "In Yakuza 6, Kazuma Kiryu will find out exactly how much people are willing to sacrifice for family - be those ties through blood or bond - when he investigates a series of shadowy events that involve the ones he holds closest to his heart. Fresh out of a three-year prison sentence, an older and weathered Kiryu comes to find out that his surrogate daughter, Haruka, has gone missing from the orphanage he looks after. The trail leads him to his old stomping grounds in Kamurocho, where he discovers that she has been struck by a car and now lies in a coma. To make matters worse, Kiryu learns that Haruka now has a son that he must look after. With baby in hand, Kiryu journeys to the seaside town of Onomichi, Hiroshima to unravel the truth about Haruka, her son, and a sinister secret that the Hiroshima yakuza are harboring.\r\n\r\nFrom the unparalleled realism of the new setting of Onomichi, a beautiful, sleepy port town in Hiroshima Prefecture, to the latest evolution of Kamurocho, the biggest red-light district in Tokyo, Yakuza 6 is the ultimate iteration the game's blend of gritty crime story, hyper-explosive combat, and all the vices and distractions those locales have to offer.\r\n\r\nEnter the \u201cDragon Engine\u201d - Explore the world of Yakuza like never before. Yakuza 6 is the first current-gen Yakuza title that was developed from the ground up for the current-gen hardware, introducing the seedy Japanese underworld with detailed visuals, lifelike animations, a new physics engine, interactive storefronts, seamless transitions and more.\r\n\r\nExplore Kamurocho Reborn and the Scenic Views of Onomichi - The hypnotic lights, opportunistic inhabitants, and hedonistic distractions of Kamurocho look better than ever. Revamped minigames like karaoke, batting cages, darts, hostesses, and the SEGA arcade have been streamlined for maximum pleasure, and new additions like the RIZAP Gym, Cat Caf\u00e9, and Clan Creator are the purrfect distractions after a long night of bashing heads! But it\u2019s also time to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life to play tourist in beautiful Onomichi. This tranquil coastal community is home to plenty of local activities like bar mingling, spearfishing (think action-packed rail shooter \u2026 with fish), and more!\r\n\r\nLet the Bodies Hit the Floor - Yakuza 6 Kiryu is a 100% certified badass, so that means he\u2019s a battle-hardened veteran when it comes to the art of street fighting. Although he utilizes one fighting style this time around, you best believe Kiryu hits like a truck. Devastating combos and bone-breaking Heat Actions make a return, but now the Dragon of Dojima can fill up a meter to engage Extreme Heat Mode. When activated, Kiryu glows blue and unleashes heavy-damage combos with his fists or any \u201ctool\u201d that\u2019s close at hand.\r\n\r\nFully Voiced Japanese Audio - For the first time in series history, every line and piece of dialogue is fully voiced in Japanese. Let the dramatic story and absurd humor of the series unfold like an interactive foreign film experience.",
